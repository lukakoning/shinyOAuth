The S7 package provides a new OOP system designed to be a successor to S3 and S4.
It has been designed and implemented collaboratively by the RConsortium Object-Oriented Programming Working Group, which includes representatives from R-Core, BioConductor, RStudio/tidyverse, and the wider R community.

This vignette gives an overview of the most important parts of S7: classes and objects, generics and methods, and the basics of method dispatch and inheritance.

```{r setup}
library(S7)
```

## Classes and objects

S7 classes have a formal definition that you create with `new_class()`.
There are two arguments that you'll use with almost every class:

-   The `name` of the class, supplied in the first argument.
-   The class `properties`, the data associated with each instance of the class. The easiest way to define properties is to supply a named list where the values define the valid types of the property.

The following code defines a simple `dog` class with two properties: a character `name` and a numeric `age`.

```{r}
Dog <- new_class("Dog", properties = list(
  name = class_character,
  age = class_numeric
))
Dog
```

S7 provides a number of built-in definitions that allow you to refer to existing base types that are not S7 classes.
You can recognize these definitions because they all start with `class_`.

Note that I've assigned the return value of `new_class()` to an object with the same name as the class.
This is important!
That object represents the class and is what you use to construct instances of the class:

```{r}
lola <- Dog(name = "Lola", age = 11)
lola
```

Once you have an S7 object, you can get and set properties using `@`:

```{r}
lola@age <- 12
lola@age
```

S7 automatically validates the type of the property using the type supplied in `new_class()`:

```{r, error = TRUE}
lola@age <- "twelve"
```

Given an object, you can retrieve its class `S7_class()`:

```{r}
S7_class(lola)
```

S7 objects also have an S3 `class()`.
This is used for compatibility with existing S3 generics and you can learn more about it in `vignette("compatibility")`.

```{r}
class(lola)
```

If you want to learn more about the details of S7 classes and objects, including validation methods and more details of properties, please see `vignette("classes-objects")`.

## Generics and methods

S7, like S3 and S4, is built around the idea of **generic functions,** or **generics** for short.
A generic defines an interface, which uses a different implementation depending on the class of one or more arguments.
The implementation for a specific class is called a **method**, and the generic finds that appropriate method by performing **method dispatch**.

Use `new_generic()` to create a S7 generic.
In its simplest form, it only needs two arguments: the name of the generic (used in error messages) and the name of the argument used for method dispatch:

```{r}
speak <- new_generic("speak", "x")
```

Like with `new_class()`, you should always assign the result of `new_generic()` to a variable with the same name as the first argument.

Once you have a generic, you can register methods for specific classes with `method(generic, class) <- implementation`.

```{r}
method(speak, Dog) <- function(x) {
  "Woof"
}
```

Once the method is registered, the generic will use it when appropriate:

```{r}
speak(lola)
```

Let's define another class, this one for cats, and define another method for `speak()`:

```{r}
Cat <- new_class("Cat", properties = list(
  name = class_character,
  age = class_double
))
method(speak, Cat) <- function(x) {
  "Meow"
}

fluffy <- Cat(name = "Fluffy", age = 5)
speak(fluffy)
```

You get an error if you call the generic with a class that doesn't have a method:

```{r, error = TRUE}
speak(1)
```

## Method dispatch and inheritance

The `cat` and `dog` classes share the same properties, so we could use a common parent class to extract out the duplicated specification.
We first define the parent class:

```{r}
Pet <- new_class("Pet",
  properties = list(
    name = class_character,
    age = class_numeric
  )
)
```

Then use the `parent` argument to `new_class:`

```{r}
Cat <- new_class("Cat", parent = Pet)
Dog <- new_class("Dog", parent = Pet)

Cat
Dog
```

Because we have created new classes, we need to recreate the existing `lola` and `fluffy` objects:

```{r}
lola <- Dog(name = "Lola", age = 11)
fluffy <- Cat(name = "Fluffy", age = 5)
```

Method dispatch takes advantage of the hierarchy of parent classes: if a method is not defined for a class, it will try the method for the parent class, and so on until it finds a method or gives up with an error.
This inheritance is a powerful mechanism for sharing code across classes.

```{r}
describe <- new_generic("describe", "x")
method(describe, Pet) <- function(x) {
  paste0(x@name, " is ", x@age, " years old")
}
describe(lola)
describe(fluffy)

method(describe, Dog) <- function(x) {
  paste0(x@name, " is a ", x@age, " year old dog")
}
describe(lola)
describe(fluffy)
```

You can define a fallback method for any S7 object by registering a method for `S7_object`:

```{r}
method(describe, S7_object) <- function(x) {
  "An S7 object"
}

Cocktail <- new_class("Cocktail",
  properties = list(
    ingredients = class_character
  )
)
martini <- Cocktail(ingredients = c("gin", "vermouth"))
describe(martini)
```

Printing a generic will show you which methods are currently defined:

```{r}
describe
```

And you can use `method()` to retrieve the implementation of one of those methods:

```{r}
method(describe, Pet)
```

This vignette outlines the most important things you need to know about using S7 in a package.
S7 is new, so few people have used it in a package yet; this means that this vignette is likely incomplete, and we'd love your help to make it better.
Please [let us know](https://github.com/RConsortium/S7/issues/new) if you have questions that this vignette doesn't answer.

```{r setup}
library(S7)
```

## Method registration

You should always call `methods_register()` in your `.onLoad()`:

```{r}
.onLoad <- function(...) {
  S7::methods_register()
}
```

This is S7's way of registering methods, rather than using export directives in your `NAMESPACE` like S3 and S4 do.
This is only strictly necessary if registering methods for generics in other packages, but there's no harm in adding it and it ensures that you won't forget later.
(And if you're not importing S7 into your namespace it will quiet an `R CMD check` `NOTE`.`)`

## Documentation and exports

If you want users to create instances of your class, you will need to export the class constructor.
That means you will also need to document it, and since the constructor is a function, that means you have to document the arguments which will be the properties of the class (unless you have customised the constructor).

If you export a class, you must also set the `package` argument, ensuring that classes with the same name are disambiguated across packages.

You should document generics like regular functions (since they are!).
If you expect others to create their own methods for your generic, you may want to include an section describing the properties that you expect all methods to have.
We plan to provide an easy way to document all methods for a generic, but have not yet implemented it.
You can track progress at <https://github.com/RConsortium/S7/issues/167>.

We don't currently have any recommendations on documenting methods.
There's no need to document them in order to pass `R CMD check`, but obviously there are cases where it's nice to provide additional details for a method, particularly if it takes extra arguments compared to the generic.
We're tracking that issue at <https://github.com/RConsortium/S7/issues/315>.

## Backward compatibility

If you are using S7 in a package *and* you want your package to work in versions of R before 4.3.0, you need to know that in these versions of R `@` only works with S4 objects.
There are two workarounds.
The easiest and least convenient workaround is to just `prop()` instead of `@`.
Otherwise, you can conditionally make an S7-aware `@` available to your package with this custom `NAMESPACE` directive:

``` r
# enable usage of <S7_object>@name in package code
#' @rawNamespace if (getRversion() < "4.3.0") importFrom("S7", "@")
NULL
```

`@` will work for users of your package because S7 automatically attaches an environment containing the needed definition when it's loaded.

## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Adjusted the DESCRIPTION to (only) writing package, software, and API names
  in quotes.
  
* Adjusted the examples, replacing `\dontrun{}` with calls to `if (interactive()) {}`
  and `\donttest{}` where appropriate. Ensured that there are no commented out 
  lines of code in examples.

Thank you for handling this submission.

# shinyOAuth: Provider-Agnostic OAuth Authentication for 'shiny' Applications

Provides a simple, configurable, provider-agnostic 'OAuth 2.0' and
'OpenID Connect' (OIDC) authentication framework for 'shiny'
applications using 'S7' classes. Defines providers, clients, and tokens,
as well as various supporting functions and a 'shiny' module. Features
include cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection, state encryption,
'Proof Key for Code Exchange' (PKCE) handling, validation of OIDC
identity tokens (nonces, signatures, claims), automatic user info
retrieval, asynchronous flows, and hooks for audit logging.
